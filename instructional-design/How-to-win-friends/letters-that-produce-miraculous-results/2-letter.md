Mr John Doe, 617 Doe Street, Doeville, N.J.
Dear Mr Doe:
I wonder if you'll help me out of a little difficulty?
About a year ago I persuaded our company that one of the things architects most needed was a catalogue which would give them the whole story of all J-M building materials and their part in repairing and remodelling homes.
The attached catalogue resultedâ€”the first of its kind. But now our stock is getting low, and when I mentioned it to our president he said (as presidents will) that he would have no objection to another edition provided / furnished satisfactory evidence that the catalogue had done the job for which it was designed.
Naturally, I must come to you for help, and 7 am therefore taking the liberty of asking you and forty-nine other architects in various parts of the country to be the jury.
To make it quite easy for you, I have written a few simple questions on the back of this letter. And I'll certainly regard it as a personal favour if you'll check the answers, add any comments that you may wish to make, and then slip this letter into the enclosed stamped envelope.
Needless to say, this won't obligate you in any way, and I now leave it to you to say whether the catalogue shall be discontinued or reprinted with improvements based on your experience and advice.
In any event, rest assured that I shall appreciate your co-operation very much. Thank you!
Sincerely yours, KEN R. DYKE, Sales Promotion Manager.
