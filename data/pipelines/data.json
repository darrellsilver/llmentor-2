Started around the same time we started in 2012. So a couple of years after you to me. But online coding became basically online coding boot camp. We sold to Chegg back when Chegg was cool and it got cooler after we were purchased, that kind of thing. It was eight years. My life summed up in two sentences.\n\nSpeaker B\nAwesome. No, that's great. You don't look old enough to have possibly been doing a company back then.\n\nSpeaker A\nOh, no, I have Chegg gray. I have my Chegg gray.\n\nSpeaker B\nI'm not seeing much gray there. That's impressive. You must have been about like 15 when you did that company.\n\nSpeaker A\nI appreciate it. No, I went to college and I graduated college. I did all the unpopular things. Yeah, but no, I'm like 42 now.\n\nSpeaker B\nWhere are you at college, by the way?\n\nSpeaker A\nI'm a native New Yorker. I went to college at Columbia. I stayed in New York.\n\nSpeaker B\nOh, that's right. Okay, awesome. That's great. Yeah, super cool. No, that's great. I just wanted to quickly just kind of calibrate there and just make sure I was caught up on just from the quick LinkedIn chat. I've been just so back and forth and a little crazy in the last couple of days, so I just wanted to make sure I wasn't confusing you with anybody else or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker B\nVery cool. Well, look, I think your thesis is right on. So by AI system learning, you mean basically some new online learning model where it's not just video, it's not just text. It's a true multimedia learning experience, but it is assisted by kind of governed by AI. Right, so it's a true it's sort of like back in the day. We all imagine the future of learning. And you'd see kids with these massive screens and stuff like that, and they would have this really rich immersive. Experience, whether learning something that had tons of visuals, animations, text, video, true multimedia and there would be some AI governing and assisting and gating progress and doing all that good stuff rather than a human, basically. Is that right? Is that what the sort of net customer experience would be, that it's like students are learning in this true multimodal way?\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah. Short answer, yes. Longer answer, it depends a little bit on what you mean by multimodal. What I mean typically is equivalent of shadowing if you had an exec coach. So transcription and analysis, role playing and scenario planning, feedback and guidance before or after an important meeting. I think those sort of rules based mentorship are the sweet spot right now, and it should expand. Things that are best practice are the sweet spot. Things that are strategy or thought partner and brainstorming are probably a little further.\n\nSpeaker B\nAfield, it sounds like. Is this for like, executives or who is the ICP? Who is the market?\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah. So I think the first time manager or the new public speaker or the executive or sorry, the exec who's in a new scenario. Yeah, that's my ICP right now, actually. But that raises a good question. What do you think of that? ICP?\n\nSpeaker B\nNo, I think there's well, yeah, boy, I mean, to try to penetrate K twelve at even higher ed is its own can of worms. You're going to deal with all those Miasmic colonists intrinsic in those institutions. Eventually we'll get there, right? Eventually kids will be learning in that kind of a way with AI and a truly rich learning experience. But it'll probably take a while and we'll be fixed and start calling all that. So yeah, I think the better and more immediate go to market is definitely around who you described. It's probably that sort of new manager, first time people who are trying to level up in their career and need that kind of coaching. It's almost like career manager. It's an AI manager, effectively. That is your kind of mentor manager helper. Is that right? Yeah, more like that.\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah. One of the things that I love about Udemy is it allows any number of different creator voices to be the one that the student chooses, as opposed to the canonical, the sort of fiction of we're going to make the canonical how to be a Better Manager book.\n\nSpeaker B\nYeah. No, I agree.\n\nSpeaker A\nI could ask a bunch of questions, but how do you want to.\n\nSpeaker B\nThe Udemy model. So do you think that the Udemy model is your thesis or hypothesis? That the Udemy model of effectively a middleman platform whereby there are content creators who are providing a wide range of content, basically crowdsourcing the content of that type and then your company sits in the middle like Udemy. Or is it more a curated model where you have your own content courses more like a plural site or all the other companies that create their own content.\n\nSpeaker A\nSo I think of it more in the Udemy style today. And the primary difference versus a pluralsight, which is a really good question, is Pluralsight had a consistent style of presentation. It had the Pluralsight style guide, basically.\n\nSpeaker B\nYes, exactly.\n\nSpeaker A\nOr it has, I guess, and Udemy has sort of lets your personality come through a lot more as the author. So that's my personal opinion. But I wonder strategically, I'm guessing the big difference is in go to market. Like if there's a go to market difference, it's done better, I guess. Both done.\n\nSpeaker B\nThere is a concept like this, I think starts with it's really the four P's. It's like, let's start with the most fundamental value prop, right? Who is the target customer? I always like to work backwards from the customer. So sort of starting with who is the target, what are they not getting today that they could be getting? Typically, it's like what pain or thing are we solving there? In this case, it's sort of like what is newly enabled that was never possible before, thanks to AI, right? And the bringing together of these disparate things. So that's sort of the opportunity. So it's like, where is that ideal sweet spot, at least the hypothesis around who this ICT is that would benefit most from this augmented sort of AI powered measuring, right? And really everything kind of falls out of that, right? So it's like you can say, okay, here is the typical types of person. It's a new manager, for example, or anybody who's X, Y or Z. Imagine X. Imagine if they could do this, imagine if they had that. And then very neatly define what that experience would be and then get very clear about why that's so much better. I mean, I really have to kind of be the classical ten X better, ideally, right? That's what you want to strive for than other options. Because they're going to have a sea of options, right? Including others who have the same idea you do or something similar we're using. Because AI is going to be like water, it's going to permeate everything. So all the existing online learning companies are going to start to use it and like that. So you'll have all kinds of AI powered online learning, this and that. So being very clear, very specific around what this thing, this idea is that is very likely not going to be well served by others for that. ICP start there. And so I think that's the first defining thing to get to. And that's just a paper exercise that's just basically thinking through it. And imagine now the key is then to build some kind of an MVP and go validate that thesis in some way and adjust it. Because it may well be that that ICP is not actually, surprisingly, for lots of reasons, like the best one, and there may be reasons for that, like new managers typically aren't going to blah, blah, blah, right? I'm just guessing. And it may be actually that, no, it's higher level executives or something like that, or lower maybe it's actually rank and file people who are like, how can I become a manager, right? How can I level up in my career in some way and not just be a cog in the machine? That kind of thing. Or you may find it become totally adjacent kind of thing. But that's I think the first work is getting as narrow as you can around value proposition to whom, how specific is that? How is that a unique hill that is ideally defensible or does something so magical, or the experience will be so great that it can build its own kind of moat and it really kind of feels ideally ten X better, right? I think that's how my brain would probably approach this. I think you're definitely onto something, for sure. And I think it's I think someone or many companies will actually nail this, right? So why not you, right?\n\nSpeaker A\nDo you think? Do you have an instinct on actually, let's go back more through the history of Udemy, if I can. Yeah, because you were there, like a pretty pivotal time. Right. It was a direct to consumer.\n\nSpeaker B\nThat's exactly right. Yeah, exactly right. So they basically just sold online courses, period. Right. And it was crowdsourced. So they had some number of courses from creators using the tools to basically just offer up these course. People would buy them all at Cart, and that was it. Very transactional. No SaaS model, no ongoing relationship model. That was it. So I came in, they hired me to build out the first basically SaaS style subscription style offering and figure out that go to market.\n\nSpeaker A\nSo it was just like, you go, you buy a course for $20 plus whatever discount.\n\nSpeaker B\nThat was it. That was it. And it was really dangerous because hope people would come back, but there's no guarantee. Right. And limited, too. Right. And that was the time, too, where SAS was starting to become attractive and starting to explode. In general, this idea of building an ongoing relationship for revenue and building AR andr models was basically so attractive to the VCs.\n\nSpeaker A\nHow did they break down revenue, if I may ask, between the creator and the platform? Because platform was driving all the leads.\n\nSpeaker B\nRight. Just a rev share. Yeah, it was really just rev share. I mean, basically, I think creators got something like 60% of the revenue from a sale, something like that, roughly, I think, at the time, and Udemy got the rest because most of the awareness came from the site and the marketing there. So it's kind of worth it. And creators loved it. I mean, they made a lot of money on the top courses. And it was hard for me to figure out the go to market because we didn't own the courses. Right. So it was really a tricky licensing approach thing. Like, how do you get all these creators who put these courses on there to agree to kind of opt in to a curated library of courses that we would choose for companies and others to have access to. Right. And how do we pay them? That right. It's like usage model based thing, which is what we have to do. So it was a tricky go to more market from a conceptual standpoint.\n\nSpeaker A\nSorry. It turned into a what market? It turned into a unit market, did you say?\n\nSpeaker B\nYeah. So basically we had to come up with how do you pay them?\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker B\nUsage based model. So basically we have to figure out an algorithm to say, okay, we're going to calculate how many plays video, and we're going to come up with an algorithm that basically determines how much to pay you each month or quarter, whatever.\n\nSpeaker A\nRight?\n\nSpeaker B\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker A\nWhich was that is different. The plural site model. Right? Plural site would pay out like, what, 30% to something like that?\n\nSpeaker B\nYeah, pluralsight though. But I mean, they were different because again, they didn't just have that crowdsourced model, at least to the buyer, they effectively created high quality premium courses. So they facilitated the creation of that and so they had a much more premium thing. We were kind of known as almost in some ways, kind of the long tail or flea market, if you will, where there's some amazing courses and then some that are bad. Right, so classic long tail kind of problem there, right. So trying to build a go to market there sort of library and kind of all that stuff was definitely challenging. But through a lot of testing and frankly, I think some luck, we cracked it. And then for me it was like kind of how do you take that to market? How do you articulate the value prop to buyers basically of that subscription library in a crowded market? Because we started competing against all the big platforms there. And so what we realized was that it's not just the content, it's the platform itself. So platform features, right. Like what kind of analytics do you get to see what your boys are doing with the courses? Are they completing? Is library up to date? All the other stuff there at the platform layer was key.\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. The Legion for the beta C side must have been like I remember it as a lot of emails once you were on the list.\n\nSpeaker B\nOh, God. Yeah. No, it was terrible. No, it was terrible. It was a very weird sort of and they knew it, it was a really hard model because it's like you have to just they were so spam malicious right. With just having to say, hey, there's more courses, come back and buy more via email right. And ads and things like that. It did work though. And the problem is though, we have to do sales all the time, so everything was always on sale. Right. And like you end a month, there was always a sale and the customer gets used to that. Right, so that was a problem.\n\nSpeaker A\nDo you think that was a moment in time of a unique go to market moment? A lot of businesses, especially in education, it's like I talked to people over the years that are like, I was able to buy ads on cable TV far below market and it turned out all my customers.\n\nSpeaker B\nAbsolutely.\n\nSpeaker A\nAnd it was like a moment you.\n\nSpeaker B\nCould like ad roll and stuff like that. And the pricing at the time to acquire customers, it worked just well enough for us to do that. The cost of social ads today are way higher. Right, still. So the economics today to try to do the same thing, especially with paid marketing, I think would be a lot more challenging. Plus that whole market changed, so you really can't compare it. But I do think that was the approach that worked then for us. And the approach that I took on building the SaaS thing was what it was because of the time period. Right? I wouldn't do it in that same way necessarily. Again, I would do differently. But what I did back then is what I described to you at the outset, which is start with the customer. Where are they underserved what unique value propper hill can we own that solves their pain? How can we most articulately and saliently communicate that to them with the fewest amount of words? So it really resonates with their brain. That's where my marketing kind of background kicks in. I live, eat and breathe messaging. Like, I love value props and messaging and strategy and stuff like that. So that was sort of for me, I love that challenge and kind of going from where we were when this thing started to that first scale. That was very much a marketing thing that I did. And I had to relieve my marketing chops there. And it was to be very sharp about the value prop right to them. And how can we stand out in this massive sea of competitors, many of whom were so entrenched? Are you so that was really challenging. And even to get customers, like, what type of customers to go after and when and why and all that kind of stuff. So we'd have to go after some small companies first to get some credibility, leverage customer evidence like crazy there to attract the bigger ones, get the kind of hot, newer, smaller companies that were the envy of the larger, staunchy companies. That was a factor that worked very well at the time.\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah. Are the competitors at the time we already mentioned Pluralsight, so that must make the list. And then presumably, safari and Linda. Are those like, the right list? If you go back to that era.\n\nSpeaker B\nYeah, I mean, it was so Linda at the time, pre LinkedIn acquisition and even Post was definitely in the bigger set. It was like pluralsight. It was Udacity and Linda. Pluralsight Udacity. And then there were all the platforms, like Cornerstone and all the other kind of older ones that had their platform. They had built in basically the content partnerships there. And there were a few others. There were MOOCs and stuff like that, too. That was the landscape.\n\nSpeaker A\nInteresting. Did you ever have to your comment about the marketplace, the sort of free for all marketplace versus curated flea market? Flea market versus curated?\n\nSpeaker B\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker A\nThe long tail. That sounds like a huge benefit. You just get so much more diversity of coverage.\n\nSpeaker B\nWell, exactly, yes and no. So this is the tricky thing when you're going to companies and they're like and they check you out and they're like, there's all this shit content on here on the site I'm seeing, how is this going to be good quality? How can you guarantee with a crowdsource model that we're not going to get a bunch of bad stuff in our library. So that's where the curation came in and I would turn it on its head and say, hey, because we're crowdsourced, we get the latest skills training first and fastest, and we carefully select which courses go into your library. And so with Udemy, you're going to get the latest cutting edge skills training on brand new topics that no one else will have yet.\n\nSpeaker A\nRight.\n\nSpeaker B\nTurn that on, Ted. They're like, oh, wow, that sounds amazing.\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah, you'll see the most niche, the most quickly. Yeah, right, makes sense. And then you would curate the library so you could avoid the sort of junk, basically.\n\nSpeaker B\nYes, exactly. It was a highly curated library. We're constantly taking courses out, adding them in, et cetera, based on feedback and things like that, too. We would add even courses based on customers saying, hey, I want a course on harassment, or something like that. We're like, okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker A\nHow did they attract creators in that era?\n\nSpeaker B\nJust, I think the promise of being able to sell your skills and that our tools were so easy to use. Great tools, great creator tools, which really I think that was the birth of Udemy. I mean, what's genius about what Aaron and that team built originally is that they focus on, you know, when you build a marketplace, you got to pick one side to focus on. They focus on supply. Right. So they focused on a creator side, made really great, easy to use tools to create courses.\n\nSpeaker A\nAnd that was just more attractive than it just attracted new people to these platforms. I guess they weren't really going to YouTube.\n\nSpeaker B\nYeah, I can take my skills, I can easily leverage my expertise. I can put it up there and I can make a bunch of money. Wow, that was great.\n\nSpeaker A\nAnd then presumably all the advocacy stuff that comes along with it. Right? Like the conference and meetups.\n\nSpeaker B\nExactly. Makes a lot of sense.\n\nSpeaker A\nIs it very developer centric throughout or was it across a lot of at what point does it branch out into lots of skills?\n\nSpeaker B\nGood question. Again, long tail. And it evolved quite a bit once we cracked the fast B to B, sort of nut as well. So we added more and more skills based kind of soft touch training as well as all the hard skill stuff. So started very much, I think, around technical training and then pretty quickly evolved into much more.\n\nSpeaker A\nMy perception right now is even today the software engineering related skills, or just hard tech skills are like at least.\n\nSpeaker B\nHalf the oh, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Which makes sense, right? Because there's big demand for that stuff. Right. And there aren't good and easy ways to go find it elsewhere other than spending time on YouTube and just trying to find good quality stuff.\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah, fair enough. Have you run into other folks working on anything similar or is it at all, your current interest anymore?\n\nSpeaker B\nIt's definitely in my current interest, for sure. No one else I know that I've spoken to is working on it, but I mean, I think, look, AI is going to again, it's going to permeate everything. And so I think there's a ton of opportunity here, and so I think you're onto something, for sure.\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah. Interesting. Where was I going to go with that? I'm surprised. I was just looking at the transcript of Udemy's last earnings call and there's no mention of anything. Like, I was surprised that they're not getting oh, really? Chegg is all they can talk about or whatever. Avoid talking about or whatever is how they basically got clobbered. Yeah, it's surprising.\n\nSpeaker B\nI mean, it's a different company than it was back when I was there, for sure. I was there fairly early with the original team, and with all due respect to the current team, I think it's a public company. No one is still there, as I remember.\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah, maybe it doesn't have the same focus on it. It's just not relevant.\n\nSpeaker B\nIt's just hard to say. I don't even know what their economics like these days. It's a whole different entity.\n\nSpeaker A\nWhat are the stuff I'm just, like, eyeing the cocktail with a couple minutes left. What's the stuff that you're most excited about now? Just changing gears.\n\nSpeaker B\nAI, for sure. AI. Absolutely. Yeah, totally. I think online learning and AI. I think that is definitely super interesting. I'm dabbling with some sort of very different stuff, too. Just like on health hacking kind of front and stuff like that. Like content stuff like that as well, which is sort of not training per se, but I'm doing some of that. But as far as my next career thing, I'm definitely looking for my next adventure at this point. Right now, I love advising companies. I'm advising and mentoring companies, for sure. So that's something I do a lot of right now.\n\nSpeaker A\nCool.\n\nSpeaker B\nBeen a lot of kind of marketing go to market, advising, messaging, that kind of stuff. It's fun.\n\nSpeaker A\nThat's very cool. I was just making a face. I found advising really fun for like a year after leaving Check Thinkful, and it was a little repetitive because basically the entrepreneur never listens.\n\nSpeaker B\nIt is absolutely so true. It is so true. And I do it just because I do some paid advising and stuff like that. Some for sock and things like that, too. So it's more like, hey, I can do this. I'm good at it. It's easy for me to do it. Why not?\n\nSpeaker A\nLow time. Yeah, definitely.\n\nSpeaker B\nI do it in my sleep, literally. It's like I can write messaging and marketing copy literally in my sleep. My brain is wired that way. And so it's like, why not use that skill?\n\nSpeaker A\nIs that the relationship you have with real vision? I'm just looking it up now. I didn't look it up before.\n\nSpeaker B\nNo, I've been present there, but I am moving on. So that's confidential, but I'm moving on.\n\nSpeaker A\nGot it.\n\nSpeaker B\nYeah. I lost my appetite for crypto, put it that way.\n\nSpeaker A\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker B\nI'm actually looking for financial adventure at this point.\n\nSpeaker A\nCool. All right, sweet.\n\nSpeaker B\nI'd love to start something. I mean, my preference would be to start something or partner up with somebody and do something interesting. That would be my preference.\n\nSpeaker A\nWe're out of time, and I got to run at the bottom of the hour for our schedule.\n\nSpeaker B\nYeah, totally.\n\nSpeaker A\nBut you're based where are you based? You're in?\n\nSpeaker B\nI'm in San Francisco. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker A\nSan Francisco. Cool. I make it out there occasionally. I'm in New York. Lower Manhattan.\n\nSpeaker B\nOh, that's great. Yeah, awesome.\n\nSpeaker A\nBut I make it out there occasionally, so no big deal.\n\nSpeaker B\nVery cool. Well, look, I'd love to keep in touch, and I think you have a great track record, and I think you're onto something, and I like how you think about this stuff, so keep me posted. Let's see if there's something we could do together in some way. Happy to keep brainstorming, and it's always good to meet great, smart founders and stuff like that, so I'd be happy to keep chatting.\n\nSpeaker A\nThat sounds great. If you know of anybody who was in those early days at Udemy, maybe on the product side or the growth side or the creator tools, maybe, I'd be curious to chat with more folks I was trying to hunt down on LinkedIn. But if anyone comes online, let me know.\n\nSpeaker B\nIt's been a while. I get it, but sure. Absolutely, Darryl.\n\nSpeaker A\nCool. Sounds good. Thanks for the time, Paul. I'll talk to you later.\n\nSpeaker B\nAbsolutely. Great to chat. Keep in touch. All right.
