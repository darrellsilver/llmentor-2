I decided to take home an old, dusty book about management. As soon as I opened it, I was hit by an eerie chill up my spine. I glanced around the library as I heard the pages turning, as if someone was reading it along with me. I felt a presence in the air as I went through the book, and after a few minutes I felt a cold hand clasping my shoulder from behind. I quickly flipped the book shut and tried to understand who or what had been reading the book with me. As I stood in the dark, silent library, I slowly turned around and saw the figure of a woman draped in a black cloak staring directly into my eyes. I could feel that she was sending me a message, but I could not make out the words. I quickly ran away, leaving the book behind, and never returned to the library again.

One day, when she was combing through the library, an old, worn book caught her eye. Its cover was faded and the pages seemed to have yellowed with age, but something about it called to her. She plucked it from the shelf and sat down to read it. As she flipped through pages, she began to notice that the book didn't seem to read like any management text she'd read before. Instead, the book seemed to be casting a spell on her, as if it had been written to be read in one sitting. Fiona read through the text, feeling an increasingly sinister pull throughout the story. Eventually, it stopped, yet the book continued as if the text were looping endlessly. Suddenly, the words of the page glowed green and Fiona shivered. Footsteps sounded from the other side of the library. Fiona closed the book with a snap and the room fell silent. For some reason, she knew she'd uncovered something sinister.
